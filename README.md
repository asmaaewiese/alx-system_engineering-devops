My shell basics 
On branch master
Your branch is based on 'origin/master', but the upstream is gone.
  (use "git branch --unset-upstream" to fixup)

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	README
	md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
shell redirections
